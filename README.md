# TelecomChurn
Telecom customer churn is a major problem faced by telecom companies around the world. Losing 
customers can have a significant impact on a company's revenue and profitability. Therefore, it is important for telecom companies to identify customers who are likely to churn and take appropriate measures to retain them. 

Machine learning techniques have been increasingly used in recent years to predict customer churn.
The problem addressed in this project is to predict whether a telecom customer will churn or not based on their usage patterns and other factors. The goal is to build predictive models that can accurately predict customer churn, and to compare the performance of different machine learning techniques. 

Main Objectives:
• To build predictive models using three different machine learning techniques: Logistic Regression, 
Random Forest, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
• To evaluate the performance of each model using various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, 
precision, recall, and F1-score.
• To compare the performance of different machine learning techniques.
• To identify the most effective technique for predicting telecom customer churn.
